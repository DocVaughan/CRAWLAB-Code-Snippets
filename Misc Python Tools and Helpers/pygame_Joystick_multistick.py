# pygame_Joystick_Basic.py
#
# script to read and process multiple axis of a gamepad for throttle and 
# steering inputs
#
# NOTE: As of 06/12/18, button numbers, etc are for Logitech F310 gamepad
#
# In one mode, when LB (left shoulder button) is held down, the left analog stick
# controls throttle and steering, up/down is throttle and left/right is steering
# 
# In the other mode, when RB (right shoulder button) is held down, the two
# analog sticks control the left and right throttle independently. The direction
# of those two throttle commands is controlled by the left/right motion of the pad.
#
# Output is printed to the screen as a pair of outputs:
#   Left throttle, left angle
#   Right throttle, right angle
#
# NOTE: Any plotting is set up for output, not viewing on screen.
#       So, it will likely be ugly on screen. The saved PDFs should look
#       better.
