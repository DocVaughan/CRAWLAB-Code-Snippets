This folder contains CircuitPython code for the sender and receiver for a heartbeat-based communication system, which could be used for an E-stop.

Any data received is considered a heartbeat, which is bad practice, in general. Please see some of the other folders in this repository for methods of properly parsing a coded heartbeat signal.
